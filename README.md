# FetchGoldBar
Gold bar testing for Fetch

Description:
This project automates the fake gold bar finder webapp. It will enter numbers corresponding to the bars to weigh and will determine which one is the fake bar based on the results. This is written in C# and uses Selenium.

How to run the test:
1. Open the project
2. Build the project
3. Open up the Test Explorer
4. Click on the Run Tests icon

Note: You could press the hotkeys Ctrl+R and then T to run the test

Future Enhancements:
- Move the logic of the weighing into a recursive function
- Query the user to find out which browser they wish to use instead of defaulting to Chrome
